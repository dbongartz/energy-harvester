energy-harvesting-eval
======================

This is an project we made in our sixth semester at the University of Applied Science Munuch in Electrical Engineering.

It contains two self designed hardware boards.
One board contains an dual source energy harvester for solar and peltier elements.
The second board mounts an e-paper display from Electronic Assembly and a few buttons.

Both boards can be mounted on an TI Fram Experimenter Board.
